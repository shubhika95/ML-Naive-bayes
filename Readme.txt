merge_imdb.py : Preprocess IMDB dataset and complies it in imdb_all.csv, which is used further in our models
BernoulliNB_IMDB.ipynb: Uses the preprocessed imdb data from imdb_all.csv and works one binary feature matrix
BernoulliNB_20NG.ipynb: preporcesses the data and works on the binary feature matrix
MultinomialNB_20NG.ipynb: works on proprocessing of data and implements multinomial naive bayes for non-binary feature matrix
MultinomialNB_IMDB: works on proprocessing of data and implements multinomial naive bayes for non-binary feature matrix
miniproj2_crossval_imdb.ipynb: performs 5-fold cross validation on IMDB dataset
miniproj2_crossval_newsgroup.ipynb: performs 5 fold cross validation on 20newsgroups data
